# Linked List Problem Solutions in C

This repository contains C programs that solve common problems using linked lists. Each file focuses on a specific linked list-related operation.

## Files and Descriptions

1. **`merge_sorted_lists.c`**
   - Merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.

2. **`find_middle_element.c`**
   - Finds the middle element of a linked list using slow and fast pointers.

3. **`remove_duplicates_sorted.c`**
   - Removes duplicate elements from a sorted linked list.

4. **`detect_remove_loop.c`**
   - Detects and removes a loop in a linked list using Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm.

5. **`intersection_of_lists.c`**
   - Finds the intersection point of two linked lists.

6. **`reverse_linked_list.c`**
   - Reverses a linked list iteratively and recursively.

7. **`palindrome_check.c`**
   - Checks if a linked list is a palindrome.

8. **`nth_node_from_end.c`**
   - Finds the nth node from the end of a linked list.

9. **`delete_node_without_head.c`**
   - Deletes a node without a head pointer reference.

## How to Run
