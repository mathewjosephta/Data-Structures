# Circular Linked List in C

This repository contains C programs for implementing and working with **Circular Linked Lists**. Circular linked lists are a variation of linked lists where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure.

## Features
1. **Create and Display**: Learn how to create and display a circular linked list.
2. **Insertion Operations**: Insert elements at the beginning and end.
3. **Deletion Operations**: Remove elements from the beginning and end.
4. **Search and Traverse**: Search for elements and traverse through the list.

## File Descriptions
- `create_and_display.c`: Code for creating and displaying a circular linked list.
- `insert_operations.c`: Code for inserting nodes at different positions.
- `delete_operations.c`: Code for deleting nodes from the list.
- `search_and_traverse.c`: Code for Searching and traversing through the list.

## How to Run in Ubuntu
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile any file using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c
   ./a.out
